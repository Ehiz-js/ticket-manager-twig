# Tickit: Simplify Your Ticket Management üöÄ

Tickit is a robust and intuitive web application designed for efficient personal ticket management. Built with a minimalist PHP backend and the Twig templating engine, it allows users to effortlessly create, track, update, and delete support tickets, providing a clear overview of their tasks through a dynamic dashboard.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get Tickit up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your desired directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tickit-twig.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd tickit-twig
```

### Install Dependencies

This project uses Composer to manage its PHP dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

This command will install Twig and any other required libraries.

### Start the PHP Development Server

You can use PHP's built-in web server for local development:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Configure Data Storage

Tickit uses a local JSON file for data persistence.

- Ensure the `data/` directory exists at the root of your project:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data
  ```
- The `JsonDataManager` will automatically create `data/users.json` if it doesn't exist when the application runs.

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## API Documentation

### Overview

The Tickit application operates as a server-rendered PHP application, where routes handle traditional form submissions and serve HTML responses. Data persistence is managed via a `JsonDataManager` storing user and ticket information in local JSON files.

### Base URL

The application is accessed from the root path `/` of the web server. All authenticated routes are prefixed with `/app`.

### Environment Variables

The application currently does not utilize external environment variables (e.g., via `.env` files). Key configurations, such as the data file path (`data/users.json`), are managed internally within the `src/JsonDataManager.php` class. For production deployment, it is recommended to externalize such paths.

### Endpoints

#### POST /login

Authenticates a user based on provided credentials.

**Request**:

```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=user%40example.com&password=securePassword123
```

  			setTimeout(() => {
  				window.location.href = "/app/dashboard";
  			}, 1500);
  		</script>
  	</body>
  </html>
  ```
- **Error (HTML Render)**: If login fails, the `login.html.twig` template is re-rendered with an `error` message.

  ```

**Errors**:

  ```html
  <!-- Example partial HTML for ticket list and form -->
  <form class="form" method="POST" action="/app/tickets">
  	<h2>Create New Ticket</h2>
  	<input type="hidden" name="edit_id" value="" />
  	<label for="title">Title</label>
